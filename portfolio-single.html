					<h3>New Year Camping Trip</h3>
					<p>This Image has been taken by one of my friends on top of #Gubałówka mountain on 30th of Dec 2015, We were fighting with snow-ball and #Nikkita (My Friend) got this rock of snow and threw it toward me. I was lucky that it was just for fun :)</p>
					<p>Gubałówka is a mountain in the Gubałowskie Foothills, above the Polish town of Zakopane. The mountain is a popular tourist attraction, offering commanding views of the Tatras and Zakopane. There's a Zakopane-Gubałówka transmitter (Polish: RTON Gubałówka ) located on the top of the mountain.</p>
